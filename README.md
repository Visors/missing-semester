# Missing Semester Learning Repository

## Introduction
This repository is created for the purpose of learning and documenting my journey through the "Missing Semester" course offered by MIT. The course, available at [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), is designed to teach essential tools and concepts that are often overlooked in traditional computer science curricula.

## Repository Content
- **Notes**: I've recorded some notes on various topics covered in the course, including shell usage, version control, debugging, and profiling. These notes serve as a quick reference for me and may also be helpful to others who are learning the course.
- **Exercises**: The repository also contains my solutions to the course exercises. Working through these exercises has been a great way to reinforce my understanding of the concepts taught in the course. My OS is macOS, so my solutions may have huge differences between others used different OS.

## How to Use
- If you're also taking the "Missing Semester" course, you can use this repository as a supplementary resource. Compare your notes and solutions with mine to gain different perspectives.
- If you're new to the course, I encourage you to visit the official course website [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) to start learning.

## Acknowledgments
I'd like to express my gratitude to the instructors and contributors of the "Missing Semester" course for creating such a valuable learning resource.
